Episode 5 recap: bound to be a controversial episode, last night we saw the burning of 95% of King's Landing at the hands of the Mad Queen. It was also an episode rife with action for the death bracket. We saw Varys burned alive, an epic Clegane-bowl, Euron and Jaime face off, and finally Jaime and Cersei's tender surrender. While audiences had anticipated that Cersei would be the last great enemy once the Night King vanquished, it is in fact Daenerys who the Starks must inevitably face off in the series finale.
