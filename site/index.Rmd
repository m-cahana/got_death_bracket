Episode 4 recap: Ghost gets banished to a castle up-state, but at least he's still a good dog. Rhaegal gets unceremoniously bolted through the neck, but at least he's gonna boost Dragonstone's dive tourism industry. Brienne gets heart-broken, but at least she got to show off her acting chops. Missandei gets beheaded, but at least her death can rationalize Dany's abrupt pivot to madness
