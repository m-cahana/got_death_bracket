Episode 4 recap, courtsey of Louis (thanks Louis!): Ghost gets banished to a castle up-state, but at least he's still a good dog. Rhaegal gets unceremoniously bolted through the neck, but at least he's gonna boost Dragonstone's dive tourism industry. Brienne gets heart-broken, but at least she got to show off her acting chops. Missandei gets beheaded, but at least her death can rationalize Dany's abrupt pivot to madness.

And some words from Bethel:

I dont know about any of you but after the battle of winterfell I had LOW expectations for last night's episode. To the old gods and the new, thanks a lot for the emotional roller coaster ride from lonely Dany w. no friends sipping her dragon frappucino to the beheading of poor missandei.

Speaking of rides, can we also talk about the 5 min ride from winterfell to kings landing? Remember when it used to take us a whole season to travel north or south? smh. In the words of Ryan Gosling, BE BETTER THAN THE GAP.

I only have one word for you Queen Cersei: Dracarys.
